Ingredients:
4 cups of fermented dosa batter
1-1.5 cups of water
4 tbsp of gingelly oil (Indian sesame oil like Idhayam)

Instructions:

1. Add enough water to the fermented batter until you have a smooth, pouring consistency. Make sure the batter is not too watery though, it should be thick-ish but fall off your spoon easily.
2. Heat a tawa or iron griddle and grease with the oil lightly. Pour about 1/2 cup batter to the centre of the tawa.
3. Using the back of your ladle, gently spread the batter with a circular motion from the centre towards the sides of the tawa.
This requires some practice but is not hard at all. As you can see, I have made dosas enough times to actually do a decent job with my left hand while taking pictures with my right. Ok, I'll stop showing off now.
Since we are not making very crispy dosas, don't spread it too thin. The dosa should be more or less evenly thick.
4. Drizzle about 1 tsp of oil around the edges of the dosa and add a few sprinkles on the top as well.
5. If your tawa is greased adequately and is not sticky, the edge of the dosa will start to come off the pan in about 1 minute or so. Use a spatula to gently lift the dosa and flip it over. Cook the other side for another 40 seconds or so and remove from pan. Serve with dosa podi, chutney, sambar, tiffin sambar, or anything that takes your fancy. I can eat dosa with pretty much anything!
